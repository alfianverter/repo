# Notice
This module is now deprecated and will only be updated when I feel like it. Please move to my new music module, [discord.js-lavalink-musicbot](https://github.com/BluSpring/discord.js-lavalink-musicbot).
# Music Test Bot
  A standalone Discord.JS music bot based on [DarkoPendragon](https://github.com/DarkoPendragon)'s [discord.js-musicbot-addon](https://github.com/DarkoPendragon/discord.js-musicbot-addon) module.
 Some parts of this code is taken from his module (v1.5.1 and v1.10.3)<br>
Developers: Naz // BluSpring, Damo // CodaEnder<br>
You are allowed to take any piece of code from here into your own music bot :)<br>
You are also allowed to fork this code and edit the code into a module.<br>
Another thing is you are allowed to not credit me (finally doing this for once)<br>
This is open-source code, anyway.<br>
I left some notes for help.<br>
<br><br>
Please join my bot's Discord server here for assistance with the module: [FoozBallKing Bot Official](https://discord.gg/CYVBkej)

# How to use
First off, `cd` into the bot folder (after downloading it) and type `npm i`. This will install all the required modules.<br>
Rename the `d_config.json` file to `config.json`.<br>
Also, please install FFMPEG. Instructions [here](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg).<br>
And also, install either node-opus or opusscript.<br>
`npm i -s node-opus` OR `npm i -s opusscript`<br>
How to use eval? Edit the code file, look for "admins" and replace the array of user IDs with yours and your trustable friends!<br>

__Common installation issues:__  
__Issue: (Trivial)__ FFMPEG was not found on your system.  
__Fix:__ Make sure ffmpeg is installed correctly and set in your PATH variable.  

__Issue: (Uncommon)__ Couldn't find an Opus engine.  
__Fix:__ `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`  

__Issue: (Rare)__ [NPM] ERR Cannot read property '0' of undefined  
__Fix:__ `npm i -g npm@4.6.1` or another lower version of npm.  

__Issue: (Rare)__ TypeError: Invalid non-string/buffer chunk  
__Fix:__ Stop using `ffmpeg-binaries`. Seriously. It's been said enough to use `ffmpeg` itself by now.

__Issue: (Trivial)__ Any node-gyp errors. (build fail, missing cl.exe, etc.)  
__Fix:__ This one is a little more complicated.  
1. Type `npm i -g --production windows-build-tools`

OR

1. Download and install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)  
2. New project -> Visual C++  
3. Install Visual C++  

If that doesn't fix your issue;  
1. Download and install the [Windows 8.1 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk)  

__Issue: (Uncommon)__ `ffluent-ffmpeg` errors.
1. Download and install ffmpeg correctly for your OS/env.
